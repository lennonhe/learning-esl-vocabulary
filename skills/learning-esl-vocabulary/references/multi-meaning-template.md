## Key Differences from Basic Template

| Aspect | Basic Template | Multi-Meaning Template |
|--------|----------------|------------------------|
| Meanings | Single "### Meaning 1" | Multiple numbered meanings |
| Most common | Not marked | Mark with "★ Most common" |
| Memory tips | Help remember the word | Help connect/distinguish meanings |
| Separators | One `---` before Memory Tips | `---` between each meaning |

## Tips for Multi-Meaning Entries

1. **Order by real-world frequency**: Put the most common meaning in everyday English first as Meaning 1, marked with "★ Most common". Base this on how frequently native speakers use each meaning in daily life, not on specialized or academic contexts.
2. **Different parts of speech**: The same word may be a noun in one meaning and a verb in another
3. **Context clues**: In "Typical usage", explain what context signals each meaning
4. **Memory tips**: Focus on how meanings relate or differ from each other
5. **Don't over-include**: Only include meanings the learner is likely to encounter
