## ESL-Friendly Definitions

When writing definitions, follow these principles to make them accessible to ESL learners:

### 1. Use Simple Vocabulary
- Avoid using difficult words to explain difficult words
- If you must use a challenging word, explain it immediately
- **Bad**: "Resilient means having elasticity and the capacity to recuperate"
- **Good**: "Resilient means able to recover quickly when something bad happens"

### 2. Be Descriptive
- Explain what it looks like, feels like, sounds like, or how it is used
- Help learners visualize or experience the word
- **Example**: "A glaze is a thin, shiny layer that covers the surface of something to make it look smooth and glossy"

### 3. Include Context
- Mention where, when, or by whom the word is commonly used
- Help learners understand the situations where they might encounter or use the word
- **Example**: "In cooking, it is usually a sweet or savory liquid brushed on food"

### 4. Use Comparisons
- Connect new words to everyday experiences or familiar concepts
- Use phrases like "similar to," "like," or "think of it as"
- **Example**: "Think of resilience like a rubber ball—no matter how hard you throw it down, it bounces back"

### 5. Aim for 25-50 Words Per Meaning
- Short definitions (10-20 words) often lack context
- Longer definitions give learners more understanding
- Include enough detail to truly understand the word

### 6. Add "In Simpler Words" Paraphrase
- After complex definitions, add a one-sentence summary
- Use the format: `> **In simpler words**: {simple explanation}`
- This gives learners a quick reference point

## Common Patterns Guidelines

The "Common patterns to remember" section is critical for helping learners use words naturally.

### Key Principles

- **Be authentic**: Only include patterns that are genuinely common in daily English usage. Do NOT make up patterns.
- **Include 2-4 patterns** per meaning
- **Format**: Use quotation marks around the pattern, followed by an em dash (—) and a brief explanation

### What to Include

- Common collocations (words that frequently appear together)
- Sentence structures or constructions
- Fixed expressions or phrases
- Preposition patterns (e.g., "convinced of", "resilient to")

### Examples of Good Patterns

- "I'm convinced (that)..." — expressing strong belief
- "run a business" — manage an organization
- "break the ice with someone" — start a conversation with a stranger
- "resilient to/against something" — able to withstand a specific challenge
- "remarkably/highly resilient" — emphasizing strong recovery ability

## Countability Indicators for Nouns

Always include countability after the part of speech for nouns.

### Indicators

| Indicator | Meaning | Can Use "a/an"? | Has Plural? | Examples |
|-----------|---------|-----------------|-------------|----------|
| `[C]` | Countable | Yes | Yes | book, idea, mistake, chair |
| `[U]` | Uncountable | No | No | water, advice, information, furniture |
| `[C/U]` | Both | Depends | Depends | experience, glass, paper, coffee |

### Format

- `**noun** [C]` - for countable nouns
- `**noun** [U]` - for uncountable nouns
- `**noun** [C/U]` - for nouns that can be both

### Examples

**Countable noun**:
```markdown
**noun** [C] - A book is a set of printed pages bound together that you can read.
```

**Uncountable noun**:
```markdown
**noun** [U] - Advice is an opinion or suggestion that someone gives you about what you should do. You cannot count advice—you give "some advice" or "a piece of advice," never "an advice."
```

**Both countable and uncountable**:
```markdown
**noun** [C/U] - Experience has two uses: (1) [U] Knowledge or skill gained over time ("She has experience in teaching"); (2) [C] A specific event ("It was a wonderful experience").
```

### Common Uncountable Nouns

ESL learners often make mistakes with these:

- **Abstract concepts**: advice, information, knowledge, news, progress, research, work
- **Materials/substances**: water, rice, bread, furniture, luggage, equipment
- **Activities**: homework, housework, travel, traffic
- **Weather**: weather, rain, snow, sunshine

### Quick Test for Learners

- If you can say "one ___, two ___s" → it's countable [C]
- If you say "some ___" but NOT "a ___" → it's uncountable [U]
- Some words change meaning: "a glass" [C] (drinking container) vs. "glass" [U] (material)
