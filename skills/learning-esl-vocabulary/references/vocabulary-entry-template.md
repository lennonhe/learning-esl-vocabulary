## Basic Template

Use this format for all vocabulary entries (both single and multiple meanings):

```markdown
# {word/phrase}

**Pronunciation**:
- 🇬🇧 BrE: /{IPA}/
- 🇺🇸 AmE: /{IPA}/

**Date learned**: {YYYY-MM-DD}

## Meanings

### Meaning 1
**{part of speech}** [C/U for nouns] - {Detailed, ESL-friendly explanation of this meaning (25-50 words). Describe what it looks like, feels like, or how it is used. Include context about where/when this word is commonly used.}

> **In simpler words**: {One-sentence simple paraphrase for quick reference.}

**Example sentences**:
1. {Example showing this specific meaning}
2. {Another example}
3. {Another example (optional)}
4. {Another example (optional)}

**Typical usage**: {When/where this meaning is commonly used}

**Common patterns to remember**:
- "{pattern 1}" — {brief explanation}
- "{pattern 2}" — {brief explanation}
- "{pattern 3 (optional)}" — {brief explanation}

---

## Memory Tips

1. {Memory tip 1}
2. {Memory tip 2}
3. {Memory tip 3 (optional)}
```

> **Multi-meaning words**: If the word has 2+ meanings, add `★ Most common` to the most common meaning's header (e.g., `### Meaning 1 ★ Most common`). See [multi-meaning-template.md](multi-meaning-template.md) for the full multi-meaning format.

## Guidelines for Common Patterns

The "Common patterns to remember" section should:
- Be based strictly on real, everyday usage patterns
- Include 2-4 common collocations, sentence structures, or fixed expressions
- Use quotation marks around the pattern itself
- Provide a brief explanation after the em dash (—)

**Do NOT make up patterns.** Only include patterns that are genuinely common in daily English usage.

## Formatting Guidelines

- Use lowercase for the title (word/phrase) - do not capitalize
- Include pronunciation with both British (BrE) and American (AmE) IPA
- Bold the "Date learned" label
- Use "### Meaning 1", "### Meaning 2", etc. for all entries (even single-meaning words)
- Include part of speech in bold before the definition
- Number example sentences
- Include "Typical usage" for each meaning
- Include "Common patterns to remember" for each meaning (based on real daily usage only)
- Use horizontal rules `---` to separate meanings from memory tips
- Number memory tips
- Keep formatting consistent across all entries

## Pronunciation Guidelines

- Use IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) notation
- Always show both British (🇬🇧 BrE) and American (🇺🇸 AmE) pronunciations
- Enclose IPA symbols in forward slashes: /{IPA}/
- If British and American pronunciations are identical, still list both
- If a word has multiple pronunciations based on part of speech, show all variants:
  ```
  **Pronunciation**:
  - 🇬🇧 BrE: /ˈrekɔːd/ (noun), /rɪˈkɔːd/ (verb)
  - 🇺🇸 AmE: /ˈrekərd/ (noun), /rɪˈkɔːrd/ (verb)
  ```
- For phrases/idioms, provide pronunciation for the complete phrase

## Guidelines for All Entries

- Use lowercase for the title (word/phrase) - do not capitalize
- Always include pronunciation with both British and American IPA
- Use the same format for single-meaning and multiple-meaning words
- For multiple meanings, you MUST mark the most common meaning (based on real-world usage frequency) with "★ Most common" on the meaning header. Order meanings from most to least common. See [multi-meaning-template.md](multi-meaning-template.md)
- Include the part of speech for each meaning (it may differ between meanings)
- Provide 2-4 example sentences per meaning
- Add "Typical usage" to help learners know when to use each meaning
- Add "Common patterns to remember" with 2-4 common collocations or sentence structures (strictly based on real daily usage)
- Use horizontal rules `---` to separate meanings visually
- Memory tips should help remember the word (for single meaning) or connect/distinguish between meanings (for multiple meanings)
- If pronunciation varies by part of speech, indicate this clearly in the pronunciation section
