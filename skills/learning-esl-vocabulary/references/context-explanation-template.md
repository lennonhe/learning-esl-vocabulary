## Memory Tips

1. Think of "over" as hovering "above" a topic - your attention is focused ON that subject
2. Similar to "about" in many contexts: "worried over" ≈ "worried about"
3. Often used with emotions: the feeling is directed "over" (toward) something
```

## File Naming Rules

- Save as `{word}-in-context.md` in today's date folder
- If file already exists, add sequence postfix: `{word}-in-context-2.md`, `{word}-in-context-3.md`, etc.
- Use lowercase for the word
- For multi-word targets, use hyphens: `work-out-in-context.md`

## Formatting Guidelines

- Use lowercase for the title (word) - do not capitalize
- Include "(in context)" in the title to distinguish from comprehensive entries
- Always include the original sentence at the top
- Mark the original sentence with "*(Original)*" in the examples list
- Focus only on the meaning relevant to the given context
- Keep memory tips specific to this usage, not general tips for all meanings
