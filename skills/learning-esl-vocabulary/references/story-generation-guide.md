## Core Principles

1. **Coherent narrative arc**: Every story needs a beginning (setup), middle (development), and end (resolution)
2. **Consistent characters**: Use 1-2 named characters throughout the paragraph
3. **Unified setting**: Keep the story in one context - don't jump between unrelated scenarios
4. **Natural word integration**: Words should fit the story; adjust the story to fit the words, not vice versa

## Story Themes

Choose ONE theme per paragraph. Match the theme to the vocabulary words when possible.

| Theme | Good for words about... | Example characters |
|-------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Workplace | business, communication, teamwork | Sarah (employee), Mr. Chen (manager) |
| Travel | movement, discovery, challenges | Alex (traveler), local guide |
| School | learning, growth, relationships | Emma (student), Professor Lee |
| Family gathering | emotions, traditions, memories | Grandma Rose, Uncle Tom |
| Problem-solving | challenges, solutions, persistence | Detective Maya, engineer Jake |
| Daily routine | habits, feelings, common actions | neighbor Mrs. Park, friend David |

## Word Integration Techniques

### Good: Word fits naturally into the narrative

> Sarah was **resilient** after the setback, staying positive and finding solutions.

The word "resilient" fits naturally because:
- The story established a setback (context)
- The character's response demonstrates the word's meaning
- The sentence flows logically from what came before

### Bad: Word forced into unrelated context

> He ate **lasagne** while planning to **stomp** on opponents.

This fails because:
- "Lasagne" and "stomp" have no natural connection
- The sentence feels random and disjointed
- No story context makes these words belong together

### Technique: Group related words first

Before writing, sort words into natural groups:

**Food words**: lasagne, spinach, appetite
**Action words**: stomp, dash, leap
**Emotion words**: anxious, delighted, frustrated

Then write separate mini-stories for each group, or find a theme that connects multiple groups naturally.

## Paragraph Structure Template

```
[Setup - 1-2 sentences]
Introduce character and situation. Use 1-2 vocabulary words.

[Development - 2-3 sentences]
Show action or change. Use 2-4 vocabulary words.

[Resolution - 1-2 sentences]
Conclude the story. Use remaining vocabulary words.
```

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing any review paragraph, verify:

- [ ] Does the story have a clear beginning, middle, and end?
- [ ] Are characters consistent throughout (same names, same roles)?
- [ ] Does each sentence flow naturally to the next?
- [ ] Are vocabulary words used in their correct meaning?
- [ ] Would a native speaker write these sentences?
- [ ] Is the setting unified (not jumping between unrelated places)?

## Examples

### Good Example (4 words)

**Words**: resilient, break the ice, collaborate, ambitious

> Sarah was an **ambitious** young professional who had just joined a new company. On her first day, she felt nervous about meeting her team, but her manager told a funny story to **break the ice** during the morning meeting. As the weeks went by, Sarah learned to **collaborate** effectively with her colleagues on various projects. When the team faced a major setback, Sarah proved to be **resilient**, staying positive and helping everyone find creative solutions.

**Why it works**:
- Single setting (workplace)
- One main character (Sarah)
- Clear arc: new job → settling in → facing challenge → overcoming it
- Each word fits naturally

### Bad Example (same 4 words)

> The **ambitious** mountain climber was **resilient**. He tried to **break the ice** on the frozen lake. Later he had to **collaborate** with rescue teams.

**Why it fails**:
- Abrupt scene changes (mountain → lake → rescue)
- "Break the ice" used literally instead of idiomatically
- No narrative flow - just sentences with vocabulary words
- Feels like a vocabulary exercise, not a story
